TODO:
-  Attacking
-- highlight current unit
-- highlight units for attack
-- figure out effects system [SWE/engine task]
-- unit generation
-- Pretty up attack view
/-- do attack, update damag

-- buttons to change chars


Auras/Effects:

many types:

OnAttack
OnTurnStart
OnTurnEnd
OnMove
OnWait
etc.... - Can add new effect points as needed.

Each has some function signature, args passed by ref so they can be modified.

each implements some base interface, and as many as wanted.


public interface IOnAttack {
	//returns if changed?
	function OnAttack(attack:AttackModel, target:UnitModel):boolean {
		 // to change stats, add short term stat auras?
		 // auras have cleanup when they fade? OR they can filter base stats. -- maybe a GetUnitStats or something
// IStatModifierAura?
	}
}

EffectController {

getEffect(obj IHasEffects, eType:Interface ){
 for (var e:Effect in obj.getEffects()) {
   if (e is eType) {
     //push onto array
   }
 }

}
